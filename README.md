AAU: I want to be able to connect with other users<br>

## Approach: 
1. Brainstorming project ideas
   1. Reviewed MVP and determine Phases 1-3
2. Created ERD & User Flow diagram for organization of ideas
3. Determine Effort vs User Value
   1. Practice Oauth to see if project was feasible
   2. Practice Heroku to see if project was feasible
4. Brainstormed HTML Layout, CSS, Styling, Color Palettes
5. Started scheduling tasks using Trello
6. Created GitHub Project Repository
7. Establish merge process with group
8. Split tasks, collaborate, and regroup on a daily basis
   1. Used Agile SCRUM Methodology
9. Deploy App on Heroku

## Challenges: 
1. Determine if Project was feasible in the given timeframe
   1. Overcame project by planning
   2. If Oauth and Heroku was not established within a day we would move to next project idea
2. Time managment ("Baby born during project timeline")
   1. Overcame by planning
   2. Effective of use of time
3. CRUD usage
   1. Overcame by reference previous labs and review document
   2. Trial and error was often a solution
   3. Googling other people's solutions
4. Aesthetically pleasing CSS styling
   1. Were not designers so we just put anything that looked cool
   2. Trail and error ("Does this look cool?")

## Additional information:
### Future Updates
- Option to order posts by "most comments", "most upvotes", or "most recent"
- Add following/followers or friends functionality
- Add more github integration such as:
  - Add ability to create a new github repo with collaborators
  - Add follow GitHub users
  - More GitHub funtionality inside HackedIn
- Add an entire private hackedin jornal entry system for private project ideas
- Edit upvote structure to be more efficient (currently embedded, but would like a referenced format for data efficiency)
